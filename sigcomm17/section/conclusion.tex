In this work, we present a new framework for building resilient NFV system, called NFActor framework. Unlike existing NFV system, where NF instances run as a program inside a virtual machine or a container, NFActor framework provides a set of API to implement NF modules which executes on the runtime system of NFActor framework. Inside the NFActor framework, packet processing of a flow is dedicated to an actor. The actor provides an execution context for processing packets along the service chain, reacting to flow migration and replication messages. NF modules written using the API provided by NFActor framework achieves flow migration and state replication functionalities in a transparent fashion. The implementer of the NF module therefore only needs to concentrate on designing the core logic. Evaluation result shows that even though the NFActor framework incurs some overhead when processing packets, the scalability of NFActor runtime is good enough to support line-speed requirement. NFActor framework outperforms existing works by more than 50\% in flow migration completion time. Finally, the flow state replication of NFActor is scalable and achieves consistent recovery time.
